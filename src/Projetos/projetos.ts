Among the main problems faced by video surveillance are the large amount of data to be processed and its quality. This project focuses on the development of scalable and accurate solutions that can process large amounts of data and can be transmitted in low resolution videos, videos containing people and vehicles far from the camera. Among the applications to be investigated are the identification of people and recognition of license plates in low quality data. ",

            description: "The social distance needed to contrai the spread of the COVID-19 virus has drastically altered the way we live. Institutions have prepared to deal with this context, but citizens, in particular the student community, tend not to be consistent in their behavior when on the premises. It is urgent to create proactive awareness-raising toais capable of exposing and dissuading gatherings in the surroundings of institutions and public spaces. This project uses the area of Computational Vision, and the areas of Communication and Interaction Design in the implementation of shock advertising techniques. A system will be created that, through captured images, will carry out an automated assessment of distances. In cases of non-compliance, it will trigger alerts and send shocking messages, addressed to offenders. In addition to automating the verification, the objective is to assess the evolution of the target audience's behavior as they are exposed to this type of stimulus. ",
